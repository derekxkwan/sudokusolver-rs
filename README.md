# sudokusolver-rs

References the backtracking search algorithm as described in this [towardsdatascience article](https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-sudoku-with-ai-d6008993c7de) by Justin Svegliato and solves a sudoku puzzle using constraint propagation (in Rust!). Work-in-progress because only have it running against the sudoku puzzle on the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) page but it at least solves that one correctly.
